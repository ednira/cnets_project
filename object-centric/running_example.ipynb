The dependency graph is composed of nodes and edges, where the nodes are the activities, and the edges are the arcs that connect one activity to another, showing the frequency and dependency relationships between them. When building the dependency graph, we need to avoid disconnected activities in the Causal nets model. This is achieved for each object type, but it is not always possible when there is more than one object type in the model because each object type has different start and end activities. To find the predecessor and successor activities of each activity, the dependency measure threshold is considered.

Note that activities {'package delivered', 'send package', 'create package', 'failed delivery'} are common to both object types. This would result in more than one edge connecting two activities, one for each object type. To solve this, edges are merged to be represented in the model, and the frequency and dependency measures of one activity followed by another are shown in different colors assigned to each object type, for clarity. This is done only for single bindings, as explained in the paper. Next, the nodes of merged edges are removed from the graph in the algorithm.
